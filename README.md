## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I focused on improving my CSS Grid skills in this project. I learned how to create a grid layout with multiple rows and columns and how to place items in specific grid areas. This helped me to create a more complex layout with multiple cards and different sections.
